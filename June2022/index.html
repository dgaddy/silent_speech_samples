      <p>The following are samples of synthetic audio generated for silently mouthed words based on facial EMG signals.  These are the first eight examples in the test set, not cherry picked.</p>
      <table>
        <tr><td><audio controls><source src="example_output_0.wav"></audio></td>
        <td class="transcript">"Henderson," he called, "you saw that shooting star last night?"</td></tr>
        <tr><td><audio controls><source src="example_output_1.wav"></audio></td>
        <td class="transcript">"He read and reread the paper, fearing the worst had happened to me."</td></tr>
        <tr><td><audio controls><source src="example_output_2.wav"></audio></td>
        <td class="transcript">"He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down stairs behind him."</td></tr>
        <tr><td><audio controls><source src="example_output_3.wav"></audio></td>
        <td class="transcript">"Some of the refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses."</td></tr>

        <td class="transcript">"At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly armed with tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against the western sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward out of Halliford."</td></tr>
        <tr><td><audio controls><source src="example_output_6.wav"></audio></td>
        <td class="transcript">"The hot water from the Martian's overthrow drifted downstream with me, so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either bank."</td></tr>
        <tr><td><audio controls><source src="example_output_7.wav"></audio></td>
        <td class="transcript">"The soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their position."</td></tr>
